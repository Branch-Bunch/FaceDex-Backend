# FaceDex-Backend [IN DEVELOPMENT]
PokeDex for people 

## Inspiration
Pokemon and being awkward developers.

## What it does
Users can run around at events like hackathons taking pictures with all their new friends. Using facial recognition we can uniquely identify anyone in our database, and if they aren't in our database you just caught a new Pokemo.... I mean person! Take a picture of anyone to get their name, social media links etc.

## How we built it
The mobile app is built for iOS using swift and back-end with node.js

## Challenges we ran into
Turns out there is actually a max size you can send of HTTP post requests which was a present surprise, also testing on production is the new meme.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making everyone's Pokedex dreams come true. Or atleast everyone with a IPhone sorry Android.

## What's next for FaceDex
Code clean up, make the UI a bit cleaner and most importantly figure out a way to scale with users.

## Built With
- javascript
- swift
